# AI Car Racing Game (Pygame)

This project is based on the following repository:  
<https://github.com/eugene-ats/Pygame-Car-Racing/tree/main>

## Learning Resources

Currently following video tutorials:

## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to build a **car racing game** where each car uses a different **pathfinding or AI algorithm** to navigate the track.

Some algorithms will perform well, others poorly, and part of the learning experience is understanding *why*.

In addition to this, we aim to introduce **artificial ("synthetic") variables** that influence car behavior and performance.

---

## Educational Focus

Students will be encouraged to:

- Contribute ideas to the **design of cars**
- Help design **race tracks**
- Propose and implement **obstacles**
- Experiment with AI behavior and tuning

---

## Core Gameplay Choice

The most important decision for each student will be their car’s **engine**, which represents the **pathfinding algorithm** controlling it.

---

## Upgrade & Economy System (Planned)

We plan to introduce:

- Swappable car parts
- A points-based or economy system
- Limited upgrade points to encourage strategic choices

---

## Supported / Planned Algorithms

Algorithms we aim to support include:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* Search
- Jump Point Search (JPS)

---

## The users can design their own carshere: <https://www.pixilart.com/draw> and by downloading the template

## Running the game via a browser (Locally)

1. Install pygbag:

    ```bash
        python -m pip install pygbag
    ```

2. Run pygbag:

    ```bash
        python -m pygbag .
    ```

3. Open your browser and go to:

    ```bash
        http://localhost:8000
    ```

## Running the game via terminal

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the game:

    ```bash
        python main.py
    ```
