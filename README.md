# This project is based off: https://github.com/eugene-ats/Pygame-Car-Racing/tree/main

## Currently watching video tutorials: https://youtu.be/V_B5ZCli-rA?si=h6fmWZTDtIat0Kqe

## The idea for this game is to be a car racing game, each of the cards uploaded uses a path finding algorithms, some of them are good, some are bad some might be bad, we also want to create artifical "synthetic" varaibles that change the behaviour of the cars

## The students should be able to also have some input into the design of the cars, maybe also the track itself and potential obsitcles of the car

## The students main choice should be their "engine" - which path finding algorithm they choose to use

## Ontop of this we might add some sort of other parts to swap out, this will be enforeced by some of point/economy system where the students only have so many points to upgrade their car
